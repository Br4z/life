# Introduction

> "We think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We believe we are making it in our own image... But the computer is not really like us. It is a projection of a very slim part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity." - Ellen Ullman,Â Close to the Machine: Technophilia and its Discontents.

...**Programming** is the act of constructing a **program**, a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do. Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating.

## On programming

...Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs built on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity. You are building your own maze, in a way, and you can easily get lost in it.

> "When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep." - Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand of Darkness.

...Computers themselves can only do stupidly straightforward things. The reason they are so useful is that they do these things at an incredibly high speed. A program can ingeniously combine an enormous number of these simple actions to do very complicated things.

## Why language matters

A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level.
