# Skimming and scanning

They are two useful reading techniques. They can help you to find information really quickly in a text.

## Skimming

It is when you look over a text quickly to get the general idea of it.

### Tips (skimming)

- Read the first paragraph and last paragraph in full.

- Read the opening words and closing words of the paragraphs in between.

- Use headings, sub-headings, bullet points or key words (those in bold, italics, capitals or underlined) to guide you.

## Scanning

It is when you look over a text quickly, line by line, hunting for key words, dates, names and numbers.

> It is a useful skill to use when you need answers to specific questions.

### Tips (scanning)

- You do not need to read every word. Just look for the information you want.

- Again, use headings, sub-headings, bullet points or key words to guide you.
