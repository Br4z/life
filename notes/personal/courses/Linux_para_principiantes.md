## Comandos básicos

- `touch [OPTION]... FILE...`: change file timestamps.

    - `-d` or `--date=STRING`: parse `STRING` and use it instead of the current time.

    > A `FILE` that does not exist is created empty, unless`-c` or `-h` is supplied.

## ¿Que son exactamente los comandos?

- `man [OPTION] [COMMAND]` (manual): allows users to access detailed information about various commands, utilities, and system calls.

    Manual pages are organized into different sections, each serving a specific purpose. The primary sections include:

    1. "NAME": provides the name and a brief description of the command.

    2. "SYNOPSIS": describes the syntax of the command.

    3. "DESCRIPTION": offers a detailed explanation of the command's functionality.

    4. "OPTIONS": lists the available command-line options and their descriptions.

    5. "EXAMPLES": provides practical examples demonstrating command usage.

    6. "SEE ALSO": suggests related commands or resources.

    - `-f` or `--whatis`: Approximately equivalent to `whatis`. Display a short description from the manual page, if it is available.

    - `-K` or `--global-apropos`: search for text in all manual pages.

        > It can be accompanied by `--regex` for regular expression searches.

    - `-k` or `--apropos`: approximately equivalent to `apropos`. Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.
