# Data communication network basis

## Communication and networks

### Concept of network communication

#### Communication

Information transfer and exchange between people and things occurs through a certain medium and behavior.

#### Network communication

Communication between terminal devices through a computer network.

### Common terms

- Data payload: information conveyed.

- Packet: data unit switched and transmitted on the network.

- Header: information segment added before the data payload.

- Tail: information segment added after the data payload.

- Encapsulation: process of adding a header and a tail to a data payload to form a packet.

- Decapsulation: process of removing the header and tail from a packet to obtain the data payload.

- Gateway: network device that provides functions such as protocol conversion, route selection and data exchange.

- Router: network device that selects a forwarding path for packets.

- Terminal device: end device of a data communication system, used as a sender or receiver of data.

### Concept of the data communication network

#### Data communication

Communication networks that consist of routers, switches, firewalls, access controllers (ACs), access points (APs), PCs, network printers and servers.

#### Switch

It is the closest device to end users, it is used to access the network and switch data frames.

#### Router

A network-layer device that forwards data packets on the Internet. Based on the destination address in a received packet, a router selects a path to send the packet to the next router or destination. The last router on the path is responsible for sending the packet to the destination host.

They achieve this goal through:

- Implementing communication between networks of the same type or different types.

- Isolating broadcast domains.

- Maintaining the routing table and running routing protocols.

- Selecting routes and forwarding IP packets.

- Implementing WAN access and network address translation.

- Connecting Layer $2$ networks established through switches.

#### Firewall

This network security device is used to ensure secure communication between two networks. It monitors, restricts and modifies data flows passing through it to shield information, structure and running status of internal networks from the public network.

They achieve this goal through:

- Isolating networks of different security levels.

- Implementing access control (using security policies) between networks of different security levels.

- Implementing user identity authentication.

- Implementing remote access.

- Supporting data encryption and VPN services.

- Implementing network address translation.

## Network types and topology types

### Network types

Based on their geographical coverage, networks can be classified into local area networks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs) and wide area networks (WANs).

#### LAN

It is a network that consists of computers, servers and network devices in a geographic area. The coverage of a LAN is generally several thousand square meters.

Typical LANs include a company's office network, a cyber bar network, and a home network.

#### MAN

It is a computer communication network established within a city.

Typical MANs includes broadband MANs, education MANs and municipal or provincial government private lines.

#### WAN

Generally, it covers a large geographical area, ranging from tens of square kilometers to thousands of square kilometers. It can connect networks of multiple cities or even networks of countries (as an international large-scale network) and provide long-distance communication.

> The internet is a WAN network.

### Topology types

#### Network topologies

A structures layout presented using transmission media (such as twisted pairs and optical fibers) to interconnect various devices (such as terminal, routers and switches).

##### Types

Are classified into star, bus, ring, tree, full-mesh and partial mesh network topologies.

## Network Engineering and Network Engineers

### Network Engineering

It refers to planning and designing feasible solutions based on network application requirements and computer network system standards, specifications and technologies under the guidance of information system engineering methods and complete organizations, as well as integrating computer network hardware devices, software and technologies to form a cost-effective network system that meets the user requirements.
