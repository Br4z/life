# How to change the ICM profile

After obtaining the ICM, proceed as follows:

1. Name the downloaded profile with a meaningful name (I can suggest a format `<monitor brand>-<monitor model>`).

2. Install the downloaded profile (right-click and install).

3. Go to "Color Management".

4. In the advance section, select  select the installed profile in "Windows Color System Defaults".

5. Close the menu and the changes will be applied.

> If you want to be sure, in the System >> Display section of settings, you will find the color profile you are currently using.
