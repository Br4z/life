# Docstring

Documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. It is specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific segment of code. Unlike conventional source code comments, the docstring should describe what the function does, not how.

## Declaring a Docstring

The docstrings are declared using triple single quotes (`'`) or triple double quotes (`"`) just below the class, method, or function declaration. All functions should have a docstring.

## Accessing a Docstring

The docstrings can be accessed using the `__doc__` of the object or using `help`.
