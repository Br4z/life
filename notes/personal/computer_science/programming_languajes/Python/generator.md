# Generator

A Generator in Python is a function that returns an iterator using the `yield`.

## Generator Functions

It is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the `yield` rather than `return`. The function’s execution is paused, and its state is saved. The next time the generator is called (for example, with `next`), execution resumes right after the yield statement.

## Generator Object

They are generated by a generator function and are iterable. Generator objects are used either by calling `next` of the generator object or using the generator object in a “for in” loop.

## Generator Expression

They are another way of writing the generator function. It uses the list comprehension technique, but instead of storing the elements in a list in memory, it creates generator objects.

```PY
generator_expression = (i * 5 for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0)

for i in generator_expression:
    print(i)
```

## Advantages

- Memory efficiency: generators do not store the entire sequence in memory, which is useful when dealing with large amounts of data.

- Lazy evaluation: values are generated on-the-fly and only when needed, which can improve performance in certain situations.

## Usage example

```PY
def fib(limit):
    a, b = 0, 1

    while a < limit:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

generator_object = fib(5)

print(next(generator_object))
print(next(generator_object))
print(next(generator_object))
print(next(generator_object))
print(next(generator_object))

for i in fib(5):
    print(i)
```
