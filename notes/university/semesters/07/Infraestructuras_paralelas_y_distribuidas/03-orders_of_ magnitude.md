# Orders of magnitude

## Definition

Generally, the order of magnitude of a number is the smallest power of 10 used to represent that number. To work out the order of magnitude of a number $N$, the number is first expressed in the following form:

$$
N = a * 10^b
$$

where $\frac{ 1 }{ 10 } \leq a \leq \sqrt{ 10 }$. $0,316 \lesssim a \lesssim 3,16$Then, $b$ represents the order of magnitude of the number.

## Uses

Orders of magnitude are used to make approximate comparisons. If numbers differ by $b$ order of magnitude, $x$ is about $10^b$ times different in quantity than $y$.
