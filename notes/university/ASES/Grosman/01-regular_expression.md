# Regular expression

Construct a regular expression on $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$ that generates all strings in which every occurrence of $00$ precedes every occurrence of $11$.

## Understanding the problem

We can translate the statement into the following rule: there cannot be $00$ after an $11$ or in other words, there cannot be an $11$ before a $00$.

> It is not asking to put a $00$ before every occurrence of $11$.

## Solution

$$
(0^* \cup 10^+ \cup 0^+1)^* (11 (1^* \cup 01^+ \cup 1^+0)^*)^*
$$

> The $11 (1^* \cup 01^+ \cup 1^+0)^*$ is wrapped because it is optional.

- $(0^* \cup 10^+ \cup 0^+1)^*$: avoid creating an $11$ sequence.

- $(1^* \cup 01^+ \cup 1^+0)^*$: avoid creating a $00$ sequence.
