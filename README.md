# Life

Notes on everything I have learned and have not been too lazy to write down.

I really like to have control over my files, so plain text files (in this case Markdown) are perfect for me, and the best thing is that these files are universal (you can open and view them with almost anything).

Feel free to make pull request to fix the bullshit you find in what I have written.
